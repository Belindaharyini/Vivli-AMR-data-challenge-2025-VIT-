Objectives
Over the past decade, awareness of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and efforts to combat it have grown significantly [1]. However, these efforts have disproportionately focused on bacterial pathogens. In contrast, resistance to fungal pathogens remains largely neglected, even though over 6 million people are affected by fungal infections globally each year. Fungal AMR presents unique challenges beyond those associated with bacterial resistance. For instance, the similarity between fungal and mammalian cell structures limits the number of potential antifungal drugs due to their toxicity to human cells [2]. Additionally, existing surveillance systems for fungal pathogens remain inadequate, even in developed regions [3]. This situation highlights the urgent need for improved methods to predict factors driving fungal AMR and their evolution. 
In this study, we leverage AMR surveillance data for the fungal pathogen Candida glabrata to demonstrate the value of large-scale spatiotemporal data in studying and predicting resistance patterns. Using Pfizer’s SENTRY dataset from the United States and Europe, we examine the impact of air pollution on resistance to fluconazole in C. glabrata. Notably, our time-series analysis reveals that time-lag effects play a significant role in predicting trends in resistance.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis: We performed an exploratory analysis of the Pfizer-ATLAS (SENTRY) Antifungal Surveillance dataset, focusing on the temporal and geographic distribution of fungal resistance. Descriptive statistics revealed that C. glabrata was a common fungal pathogen, with many isolates resistant to at least four antifungal agents from 2010 to 2023 (Fig. 1a and 1b). Infections were most prevalent in individuals aged 60 and older, with no significant gender differences. Blood cultures were the primary source of isolates (71%), followed by bronchoalveolar lavage samples. The dataset included susceptibility profiles for three echinocandins—anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin—as well as the azole fluconazole. Susceptibility labels were standardized: 'Resistant' (R), 'Susceptible' (S), and 'Intermediate' (I) (reclassified as 'Susceptible' for analysis). Spatiotemporal analysis revealed consistent data availability across the U.S., Germany, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Belgium, Spain, and France from 2010 to 2023 (Fig. 1d). For regional comparisons, we grouped European countries under the Western European region. 
Composite Phenotype Generation and Geospatial Dynamics (2010–2023): To assess multidrug resistance, we created composite phenotypes [4] based on susceptibility to anidulafungin (ANI), caspofungin (CAS), micafungin (MIC), and fluconazole (FLU). Each isolate received a 4-letter code (e.g., SSSS for the isolate sensitive to all four antifungals and RRRR for the isolate resistant to all four antifungals) reflecting its resistance profile. We analyzed the geographic and temporal prevalence of five dominant composite phenotypes (SSSS, SSSR, RSSS, RRRS, and RRRR) across the U.S. and Western Europe from 2010 to 2023. Resistance proportions were calculated annually for each country.
Statistical Analysis of Air Pollution’s Impact on Resistance Evolution: We examined the association between air pollution and dominant composite resistance phenotypes in the U.S. and Western Europe. We sourced the air quality data (2010–2021) from the WHO's Ambient Air Quality Database (version 6.1, January 2024), which includes annual mean levels of NO₂, PM₁₀, and PM₂.₅, averaged at the city/regional level. We further summarized the data to obtain values for the U.S. and Western Europe. We used Spearman rank correlation to assess monotonic relationships between pollutant levels and phenotype proportions. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with clustered standard errors accounted for intra-regional and temporal dependencies. Univariate regressions (one pollutant at a time) avoided multicollinearity. Associations were considered significant at p < 0.05.
Time-Lagged Modeling of Antifungal Resistance Dynamics: To model delayed effects of pollution on resistance, we performed time-lagged analyses by shifting pollutant variables (PM₂.₅, PM₁₀, NO₂) forward by 1, 2, and 3 years for both the U.S. and Western Europe [5]. All analyses were conducted in Python 3.10 via Google Colab for reproducibility. Key libraries included Pandas (1.5.3), NumPy (1.24.3), SciPy (1.10.1), and StatsModels (0.14.0) for statistical analysis. Visualization used Matplotlib (3.7.1), Seaborn (0.12.2), and Plotly (5.18.0). Geospatial analysis utilized pycountry (version 22.3.5) for ISO 3 codes and geopandas (version 0.13.2) for choropleth mapping.
Results
Time-series and spatial-temporal analyses show an increase in fluconazole resistance.
We analyzed the five dominant composite phenotypes of 4055 C. glabrata isolates from the Pfizer-ATLAS (SENTRY) Antifungal Surveillance Dataset for antifungal susceptibility between 2010 and 2023 (Figure 1).

The major composite phenotypes identified included SSSS, SSSR, RSSS, RRRS, and RRRR, representing combinations of resistance and susceptibility to the four drugs: anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin, and fluconazole (in this order, Fig. 2a). The SSSS phenotype (full susceptibility) and the SSSR phenotype (fluconazole resistance with echinocandin susceptibility) were the most prevalent subtypes across all years. Spatiotemporal analysis revealed consistent reporting of C. glabrata isolates from both the U.S. and Western Europe throughout the study period (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, spatiotemporal analysis of the SSSS and SSSR phenotypes revealed changing proportions of resistance across years. In the U.S., a higher proportion of SSSR isolates has emerged in recent years, while Western Europe has shown a variable but notable increase in fluconazole-resistant profiles (Fig. 2c).

Statistical analysis indicates a significant association between air pollution exposure and the prevalence of dominant composite phenotypes.
We examined the regional trends (U.S and Western Europe) and associations of dominant phenotypes with annual air pollutant concentration values of NO₂, PM₂.₅, and PM₁₀ from 2010 to 2021 (Fig. 2d). We performed Spearman correlation analysis and simple linear regression for each region to evaluate relationships between pollutant levels and composite phenotypes. The U.S showed statistically significant associations (p < 0.05) between NO₂ concentrations and the SSSR phenotype (ρ = 0.61), as well as a negative correlation with the RRRS phenotype (ρ = -0.63). These results suggest that in the U.S, higher NO₂ levels are associated with increased fluconazole-resistant phenotypes. Conversely, Western Europe did not display any statistically significant associations at p < 0.05 (Fig. 3a). Considering that environmental pressures may have delayed effects [6], we conducted a time-lagged regression and correlation analysis (Fig. 3b).

Prolonged exposure to air pollution promotes resistance in C. glabrata.
The delayed effects of air pollution on the development of antifungal resistance were studied using time-lagged correlation and regression analysis with lag periods of 1, 2, and 3 years. The regression analysis (Fig. 3b) revealed that the regression coefficients between phenotypes and pollutants increased as the lag year lengthened. In the U.S, NO₂ exhibited a statistically significant positive lagged association with the SSSR phenotype at 2- and 3-year lags, while PM₂.₅ showed positive associations at a 3-year lag. The SSSS phenotype had a negative association at the 3-year lag, suggesting a potential delayed environmental effect on resistance development and reduced pan-susceptibility. The regression coefficients for these associations increased in magnitude with more extended lag periods, particularly for fluconazole-resistant phenotypes. Meanwhile, Western Europe exhibited significant lagged associations, with the RRRS phenotype positively linked to PM₂.₅. Additionally, PM₁₀ with SSSR/RSSS phenotypes demonstrated a positive correlation at lag 3, although with a smaller magnitude (Fig. 3c and 3d). The significant lagged regression coefficient indicates that the U.S exhibited stronger and more consistent delayed associations between air pollutants and resistance phenotypes compared to Western Europe. This shows that exposure to air pollutants in prior years correlates with the gradual emergence of drug-resistant Candida glabrata phenotypes, particularly in the U.S.
Impact of the work

To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a positive association between air pollution and infections caused by fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata. Our key finding is the association between air pollutants and time lag in fungal resistance. While previous studies have linked PM2.5 with resistance in various bacterial species [7], these effects appear to be immediate, likely due to the transmission of resistant pathogens or genes via particulate matter. In contrast, our findings suggest a delayed association between air pollution and resistant fungal infections. We believe this is less about direct transmission and more about increased patient susceptibility. For example, C. glabrata infections are known to readily develop fluconazole resistance [8], and prolonged exposure to pollutants like PM2.5 and NO₂ may heighten vulnerability to these infections. Subsequent treatment with fluconazole could then lead to resistance. To validate this hypothesis, we would require patient-level data on C. glabrata infections and the treatments prescribed—currently a limitation of our study. Other unaccounted factors, such as sanitation levels, climate, and antibiotic stewardship policies in the U.S. and Western Europe, may also influence the observed resistance patterns. For the air-pollution parameters, we used summary values, which may have limited the scope of our conclusions; this issue needs to be addressed in the detailed analysis. Despite these limitations, our study highlights a novel, time-lagged link between air pollution and antifungal resistance in C. glabrata, opening several promising directions for future research.
